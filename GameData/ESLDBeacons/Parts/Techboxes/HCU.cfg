description = It turns out that being compressed into a particle stream and shoved through an explosive tear in the fabric of the universe has a few negative health effects, like immediate death.  The Heisenkerb Compensator allows for safe crew transport, and as a bonus probably makes beacon transport stable enough to allow Karborundum and other high-energy materials through.
