description = The first test transport to Jool was an unqualified success, but only because the conditions for success did not specify that the probe had to remain intact rather than rocket into Jool at 11km/s.  The alignment matrix increases the energy of the initial beacon reaction and uses it to match the relative velocity vector of the target beacon.  Fuel costs will scale accordingly.
